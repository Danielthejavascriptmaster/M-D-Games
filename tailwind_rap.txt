(Verse 1)
I was stuck in CSS, margins all wrong,
Padding 12px? Why my div so long?
Naming classes like a caveman’s cry,
.card-wrapper-main-final-v2 why??

Then Tailwind pulled up like “bro, relax,”
p-4, flex, now I’m back on track,
No more hunting styles in a dusty file,
I style in my HTML, took me half a while 💨

(Chorus)
Tailwind is the way, yeah we ridin’ that breeze 🌬️
Utility drip, got my layout on freeze 🧊
From idea to UI in a blink of an eye,
Why fight with CSS when the wind’s on your side?

Tailwind is the way, yeah the future’s right here 🚀
No messy class names, no spacing fear
Ship it fast, keep it clean, let the divs obey,
Say it loud with me now: TAILWIND IS THE WAY 😤

(Verse 2)
I don’t write stylesheets, I write intentions,
justify-between, instant dimensions,
Consistent scale, yeah the UI tight,
No more random pixels ruining my night 🌙

They say “too many classes,” I say “nah,”
That’s just CSS but you can read it raw,
I see my layout just by reading the line,
HTML so honest it be snitchin’ on design 🕵️‍♂️

(Bridge)
Headwind? Nah.
Debug? Rare.
Tailwind got me shipping with aerodynamic flair ✈️
No more “why is this broken” despair,
My divs behave like they actually care 😌

(Final Chorus)
Tailwind is the way, yeah we ridin’ that breeze 🌬️
From noob to builder in like two weeks
Learn CSS while you build, that’s the play,
Not “someday soon” — nah, TODAY

Tailwind is the way, say it with pride 😎
Flex on the layout, let the spacing decide
From small lil’ buttons to a full app display,
One wind, one truth: TAILWIND IS THE WAY 🧭
